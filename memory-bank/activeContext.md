# Memory Bank: Active Context

## Current Focus

Level 3 Feature Implementation: Dive Sites Map with Marker Clustering

## Current Task

- Implementation completed successfully
- All components created and integrated
- API integration working
- Testing passed
- Ready for reflection phase

## Project State

- **Status**: Level 3 implementation complete
- **Phase**: IMPLEMENT Mode - Feature Implementation Complete
- **Complexity**: Level 3 (Intermediate Feature)
- **Priority**: High (Feature implementation)

## Recent Changes

- Memory Bank files were deleted
- Recreating Memory Bank directory structure
- Reinitializing core Memory Bank files
- Analyzing project package.json and structure
- New task identified: Display dive sites on map with marker clustering
- Task complexity determined as Level 3
- Transitioned to PLAN mode for comprehensive planning
- Level 3 planning rules loaded

## Next Steps

1. Begin reflection phase
2. Document implementation lessons
3. Assess design decisions effectiveness
4. Create reflection document
5. Prepare for archiving

## Current Context

- Operating System: macOS (darwin 24.6.0)
- Project: The Dive Map (Next.js + React + TypeScript)
- Package Manager: pnpm
- Testing Framework: Playwright
- Database: Supabase

## Active Considerations

- Memory Bank structure compliance
- Platform-specific adaptations
- Project complexity assessment
- Workflow determination
- Recovery from file deletion
- Map marker clustering implementation
- API integration for dive sites
- Performance optimization for map rendering
