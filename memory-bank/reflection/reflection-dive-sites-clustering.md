## Challenges

### 1. **Clustering Algorithm Complexity**

- **Initial Grid-based Approach**: The original grid-based clustering was too rigid and created unnatural groupings
- **Radius Tuning**: Finding the right balance for cluster radius across different zoom levels required multiple iterations
- **Performance vs Accuracy**: Balancing clustering accuracy with performance optimization

### 2. **State Management Issues**

- **Clustering Indicator**: The loading indicator was stuck in "always showing" state due to improper state management
- **Component Lifecycle**: Managing component state during map interactions and data updates

### 3. **Algorithm Debugging**

- **Distance Calculation**: Ensuring proper distance calculations in geographic coordinates
- **Cluster Formation**: Debugging why only 5 clusters were formed from 51 points
- **Zoom Level Logic**: Fine-tuning the logic for when to show clusters vs individual markers

### 4. **Integration Complexity**

- **MapLibre GL Integration**: Integrating custom clustering with MapLibre GL's coordinate system
- **API Integration**: Proper error handling and loading states for dive sites API
- **Component Communication**: Managing communication between map layer, clustering manager, and UI components

## Lessons Learned

### 1. **Algorithm Design**

- **Distance-based > Grid-based**: For geographic clustering, distance-based algorithms provide more intuitive results
- **Adaptive Parameters**: Clustering parameters should adapt to zoom level and data density
- **Debug First**: Extensive logging and debugging tools are essential for algorithm development

### 2. **Component Architecture**

- **Separation of Concerns**: Clustering logic should be separate from UI components
- **State Management**: Proper state management is crucial for complex interactive features
- **Error Boundaries**: Always implement proper error handling and fallbacks

### 3. **Development Process**

- **Level 3 Workflow**: The structured Level 3 workflow significantly improved development quality
- **Creative Phases**: Dedicated design phases help identify and solve complex problems early
- **Iterative Development**: Multiple iterations were needed to get clustering parameters right

### 4. **Performance Considerations**

- **Throttling**: Throttled updates are essential for smooth map interactions
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup and state reset prevents memory leaks
- **Rendering Optimization**: Only render visible markers and clusters

## Process Improvements

### 1. **Testing Strategy**

- **Unit Tests**: Should have implemented unit tests for clustering algorithm earlier
- **Integration Tests**: Need better integration testing for map interactions
- **Performance Testing**: Should test with larger datasets from the start

### 2. **Documentation**

- **API Documentation**: Better documentation of clustering parameters and their effects
- **User Guide**: Create user guide for clustering behavior and interactions
