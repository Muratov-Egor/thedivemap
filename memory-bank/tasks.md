## Component Analysis

### New Components to Create

- **DiveSiteMarker**: Individual dive site marker component
- **MarkerCluster**: Clustered markers visualization
- **DiveSiteInfoWindow**: Information popup for dive sites
- **ClusteringManager**: Logic for marker clustering algorithm
- **DiveSitesLayer**: Map layer for dive sites data

### Existing Components to Modify

- **MapContainer**: Add dive sites layer and clustering support
- **MapContext**: Extend with dive sites state management
- **API Integration**: Add dive sites API client

### Dependencies

- **MapLibre GL**: For map rendering and marker management
- **Clustering Library**: For marker clustering algorithm
- **Supabase**: For dive sites data storage
- **React Context**: For state management

## Architecture Decisions

### Clustering Strategy

- **Grid-based clustering**: Divide map into grid cells
- **Dynamic clustering**: Recalculate on zoom/pan
- **Performance optimization**: Limit visible markers

### Data Flow

- **API ‚Üí Context ‚Üí Layer ‚Üí Markers**
- **Real-time updates**: WebSocket for live data
- **Caching**: Local storage for offline support

## Creative Phases Required

- [x] üé® UI/UX Design: Marker interaction patterns
- [x] üèóÔ∏è Architecture Design: Clustering algorithm
- [x] ‚öôÔ∏è Algorithm Design: Performance optimization

## Current Phase

IMPLEMENT Mode - Feature Implementation Complete

## Next Phase

REFLECT Mode - Implementation Analysis

## Dependencies and Risks

### Technical Dependencies

- **MapLibre GL**: Core map functionality
- **Clustering Library**: Need to research and select appropriate library
- **Supabase API**: Dive sites data source
- **React Performance**: Large dataset rendering

### Potential Risks

- **Performance**: Large number of markers may cause lag
- **API Reliability**: External API dependencies
- **Browser Compatibility**: MapLibre GL compatibility
- **Mobile Performance**: Touch interactions on mobile

### Mitigation Strategies

- **Lazy Loading**: Load markers progressively
- **Caching**: Cache API responses locally
- **Fallbacks**: Graceful degradation if API fails
- **Testing**: Comprehensive testing across devices
